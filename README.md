This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

# Next.js Blogging Website

Welcome to our Next.js blogging website repository! This project aims to provide a platform for content creators to publish articles, share insights, and engage with their audience. Below is an overview of the project, including its architecture, development workflow, technical choices, and future goals.

## Overview

Our Next.js blogging website leverages the power of Next.js, a React-based framework known for its performance and flexibility. The architecture includes both frontend and backend components, with data storage handled using a combination of MDX files for blog content and Firebase Firestore for user-related data.

## Development Workflow

We follow a streamlined development workflow:

1. **GitHub Repository**: All code is stored and managed in our GitHub repository.
2. **GitHub Codespaces**: Developers can work in GitHub Codespaces, providing a consistent and customizable development environment.
3. **Git Flow**: We utilize a Git flow branching model, with feature branches for new developments and pull requests for code review.
4. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Changes are automatically tested and deployed to Vercel upon merging to the main branch, ensuring a smooth deployment process.

## Technical Choices

We made several technical choices to optimize performance, security, and developer experience:

- **Next.js**: Chosen for its server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities, as well as its rich ecosystem of plugins and tools.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Selected for its real-time database capabilities and seamless integration with Next.js for managing user-related data.
- **Vercel**: Hosting platform chosen for its serverless architecture, automatic scaling, and global CDN distribution.

## Performance Metrics

We track key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of our platform, including:

1. **Page Load Time (PLT)**: Aim for an average PLT below 2 seconds for optimal user experience.
2. **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Target TTFB below 200 milliseconds to ensure fast server response times.
3. **Conversion Rate**: Measure the percentage of visitors who sign up or engage with our content, aiming for continuous improvement.

## Future Goals

Our goals for performance and user engagement are ambitious but achievable:

1. **PLT Goal**: Reduce average PLT to 1.5 seconds through optimization techniques such as code splitting and image optimization.
2. **TTFB Goal**: Achieve TTFB below 100 milliseconds by optimizing serverless function execution times and database queries.
3. **Conversion Rate Goal**: Increase conversion rate by 20% within the next quarter through UX/UI enhancements and targeted content marketing campaigns.
